Simple-Backbone-List-App
========================

Simple Backbone List App from Mozilla UX Prototyping Meetup on June 21, 2012.

Open up the web inspector in Firefox (cmd + ctl + k) and try these commands:

Add to the list:

    items.add({ title: 'Feed the dog' })

Remove the last item from the list:

    items.pop()

There's more! Check out the [Backbone docs](http://backbonejs.org/) to learn about Model functions and events.
